## Project Setup and Installation

Follow the instructions below to set up the **SCLMP** project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have the following software installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **MongoDB**: [Download MongoDB Community Edition](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) or set up a MongoDB Atlas account.
- **Git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the project repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/SCLMP.git
cd SCLMP

Step 2: Install Backend Dependencies
1. Navigate to the backend folder (if not already in it):
cd backend

2. Install required dependencies using npm:
npm install

Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
1. In the root directory of the project, create a .env file to store environment variables. The .env file should contain:
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/sclmp
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI: MongoDB connection string (replace with your MongoDB URI, local or cloud-based via MongoDB Atlas).
PORT: The port number where the backend server will run (default is 5000)

Step 4: Start the Backend Server
Run the backend server by executing:
npm start
The backend should now be running at http://localhost:5000

Step 5: Install Frontend Dependencies
1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
cd ../frontend
2. Although the frontend is static (HTML, CSS, JS), itâ€™s a good idea to use a local server to run the application during development. You can install Live Server in VS Code or use a simple HTTP server to serve your files. If you're using Live Server in VS Code:

Right-click index.html (or any HTML file).
Select "Open with Live Server".
The frontend should now be accessible at http://localhost:5500 or whichever port is provided by your server.

Usage
Sign Up: Users can sign up by providing their name, email, password, and role (Student or Teacher). Admin users will be able to create or manage other users.
Login: After signing up, users can log in using their credentials, which will be authenticated using JWT.
Dashboards:
Admin Dashboard: Admins can manage users and oversee platform activity.
Teacher Dashboard: Teachers can manage courses, assignments, grades, and track student progress.
Student Dashboard: Students can access learning materials, submit assignments, and track their progress.
